    "The key measure of success would be if both cities are able to reimburse drivers of all toll costs. The other key measure of success would be to measure total number of cross-city trips. I chose this because this encourages drivers to be available in both cities, and if drivers are more evenly distributed between both cities, we might expect average wait time to decrease. Measureing the total number of cross-city trips would allow us to get a direct measurement of the effect of the policy."

In other words, if the p-value is small, it is unlikely that the observed difference in the number of cross-city trips happened by chance alone, and is likely due to the policy change.\n",
